# TODOPY

A Python program that functions as a CLI TODO app. It only has basic functions, Adding the task, viewing it, and marking it as complete which is just removing it. It stores the data in tasks.txt in the same directory (it can create one automatically).

This code isn't decent or efficient. This was made with almost no prior coding experience and I am just learning so there are a lot of places for major improvements but for now, it does what it is meant to do.
